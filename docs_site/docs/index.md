## About our project

### Context and motivation
<br>

The real estate sector is constantly evolving and requires more and better solutions for finding properties.

Currently, real estate search platforms are opting for a more traditional solution, focusing only on the physical characteristics of the property, without considering the factors related to the area where the property is located. This factor is extremely important to the client and can be the deciding factor in the final selection of the property.

Lack of familiarity with the area can make it difficult to assess the quality of life, convenience, and suitability of the area for your particular needs. This can lead to less informed buying decisions and possibly dissatisfaction with your property choice.
